                    SoirEe Disarray is a game where you are provided with a group of three boys and three girls.
                    They are sitting in a row of chairs and all conversation has frozen,
                    partly due to adolescent nerves and partly due to the fact that all the boys are huddled up
                    and refusing to look at the girls (and vice-versa). 
                    The boys are huddled at the left and the girls are huddled at the right.
                    So, from left to right, the agent sees three boys followed by three girls in a row. 
                    No one is having a good time, and it is your job as the organizer of this party to 
                    make sure this dilemma is resolved. But get to it quickly,
                    as the longer it takes to get them in the right order, 
                    the closer their curfew will be and the less time they’ll have to enjoy.
