                    Soiree Disarray is a game where you are provided with a group of three boys and three girls.
                    They are sitting in a row of chairs and all conversation has frozen,
                    partly due to adolescent nerves and partly due to the fact that all the boys are huddled up
                    and refusing to look at the girls (and vice-versa). 
                    The boys are huddled at the left and the girls are huddled at the right.
                    So, from left to right, the agent sees three boys followed by three girls in a row. 
                    No one is having a good time, and it is your job as the organizer of this party to 
                    make sure this dilemma is resolved. But get to it quickly,
                    as the longer it takes to get them in the right order, 
                    the closer their curfew will be and the less time they’ll have to enjoy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are some other technical details about the game to consider. 
                    Boys are indistinguishable from other boys and girls are indistinguishable from other girls. 
                    An action comes in the form of picking two people of opposite sexes to swap seats, 
                    and the cost of action is measured in time. The distance between chairs is one meter long, 
                    and the walking speed is one meter per unit of time (the boys and girls get up simultaneously). 
                    Moreover, standing up is an awkward process, and takes another unit of time. 
                    Due to them having cold feet (both literally and metaphorically), 
                    a boy and a girl may only swap places if they are either directly 
                    adjacent to each other or a seat apart from each other. 
                    Thus, if they are adjacent to each other, then the swap costs 2 units 
                    and if they are a seat apart, then the swap costs 3 units of time.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    A seating arrangement is deemed as desirable 
                    if it follows the “partitioning” of the row suggested by one of the members. 
                    A “partitioning” is a set of arrangements which corresponds to an order in which groups of 
                    like sexes are seen from the leftmost seat to the rightmost seat. For example, 'BBGBGG' corresponds 
                    to a 'BGBG' partition, since starting from the left, you see a group consisting of 2 boys, 
                    then a group consisting of 1 girl, then a group consisting of 1 boy, and finally a group consisting of 2 girls. 
                    Take note that 'BBGGBG' also corresponds to a 'BGBG' partition.
